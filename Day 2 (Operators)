Day 2
Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations
Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
let a=10;
let b=5;
sum=a+b;
console.log(sum);

Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
let a=10;
let b=5;
diff=a-b;
console.log(diff);

Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
let a=10;
let b=5;
product=a*b;
console.log(product);

Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
let a=10;
let b=5;
result=a/b;
console.log(result);

Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.
let a=10;
let b=5;
rem=a%b;
console.log(rem);

Activity 2: Assignment Operators
Task 6: Use the += operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
let a=10;
a+=5;;
console.log(a);

Task 7: Use the -= operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.
let a=10;
a-=5;
console.log(a);

Activity 3: Comparison Operators
Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using > and < and log the result to the console.
let a=10;
let b=15;
console.log(a>b);
console.log(a<b);

Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using >= and <= and log the result to the console.
let a=10;
let b=10;
console.log(a>=b);
console.log(a<=b);

Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using == and === and log the result to the console.
let a=10;
let b=10;
console.log(a==b);
console.log(a===b);

Activity 4: Logical Operators
Task 11: Write a program that uses the && operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
let a=10;
let b=5;
console.log(a>0&&b>0);

Task 12: Write a program that uses the || operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
let a=10;
let b=5;
console.log(a>0||b>0);


Task 13: Write a program that uses the ! operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.
let bool =true;
console.log(!bool);

Activity 5: Ternary Operator
Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.let a=15;
let result=a>=0?"positive":"negative";
console.log(result);
